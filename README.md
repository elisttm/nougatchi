# Opinions
1. The Unlicense does nothing to further help Open Source Software, by allowing its software to become Proprietary and unable to be learnt from.
2. The JSON license is not Open Source, as its clause of "The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil." is too dependant on the licensee, allowing this licensee to determine which software is "Good" software, and which software is "Evil" software.
3. Software which makes operating a system easier (e.g. drivers) should NOT be propietary. Unless if the API's to access this software a public there should be no "monopoly" over certain hardware.

# Quotations
> Freedom of expression is the matrix, the indispensable condition, of nearly every other form of freedom. - Benjamin N. Cardozo

> If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear. - George Orwell

> There's no fine line between "free speech" and "hate speech": Free speech is hate speech; it's for the speech you hate – and for all your speech that the other guy hates. If you don't have free speech, then you can't have an honest discussion. - Mark Steyn

> The people supporting free speech now are the conservatives. It’s incomprehensible to me, but it’s the so-called liberals on campus, the students who think of themselves as activists, who are becoming increasingly authoritarian. So I’m trying to step carefully. It’s not like you want to make certain allies, particularly the men’s rights people. - Laura Kipnis
